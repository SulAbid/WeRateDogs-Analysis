# WeRateDogs-Analysis
In this project I have gathered data from different sources, assessed it, cleaned it. 

## Data:
### Data Gathering:
- Enhanced Twitter Archive Dataset: 
This dataset was given to us as a file on hand, and it was a comma-separated values file, aka CSV file.
- Image Prediction Dataset:
This dataset was extracted using Requests library in Python, we used Requests to retrieve the data from Udacity’s servers and the data were in TSV file format.
-Tweets Dataset:
This dataset was retrieved from Twitter’s API using Tweepy library, The data were in JSON format.

### Data Assessment:
After gathering the data, we must assess it programmatically and visually to find any tidiness or quality issues.

### Data Cleaning:
After the assessing the issues within the data, we have to fix it using libraries like Pandas and NumPy, and that’s what we have done in this part using Define, code and test technique.
